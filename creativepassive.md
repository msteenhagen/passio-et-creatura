Some individuals specialise in passivity for creative purpose. What do I mean? Think of writers of fiction. It is well known that in writing a fictional narrative that involves some characters, a writer is likely to arrive at a point where their characters start speaking for themselves. All the writer needs to do is 'listen' to what the character says next, or 'observe' how they respond in a certain situation. In a sense, the act of writing becomes close to an act of recording, as opposed to an act of invention. Fiction writer Susan Rochette-Crawley writes about her own work that 

>in order to begin a short story, I must hear a strong voice, see a vivid image, inside me. If I am to write that story I must understand how the 'voice' or image, usually so insistent I can't resist putting it down on the page, differs from what I know about myself, and how the differences between my life and the life of the story either overlap or completely depart from one another [@lee2005aa, p. 174].

This is peculiar, as it seems that at such moments many writers feel at their most creative. As writer Olive Senior remarks,

>many of my characters have chosen to speak the story in whatever language they would use in real life, often sliding along the continuum between standard English and Jamaican Creole. I say chosen because this is how increasingly the story comes to me, in the form of the voice speaking, including the internal voice. Once the character is allowed to speak, then everything else that contributes to story—narrative, scene, setting, description, other characters, and so forth—will automatically fall into place, for speakers do not arrive bereft; they bring their entire worlds with them [@lee2005aa, p. 42].

It is because writing a novel requires of us to engage in a specific kind of mental activity, a kind of activity that in some way manages to harness passive elements into an active or creative endeavour, that writers will often come to experience 'voices' of such characters as determining the course of the story.

If this is right, then there is an element of passivity in the experience of writing fiction that at least closely resembles the kind of passivity involved in the schizophrenic cases. In schizophrenia, as is well known, people may be overtaken by the experience of voices or thoughts that they do not feel to be their own. The connection between creativity and pathology has often been made (see e.g. Freud's and Freud and Breuer's remarks on this). But the comparison allows us to identify a specific sort of activity that is constitutive of at least some forms of creative thought, and at the same time embodies, again constitutively it seems, a kind of mental passivity. 

In what follows I want to defend the claim that in order to make sense of this phenomenon, we cannot but describe it in terms that are, strictly speaking, unfit and inappropriate. We naturally speak of 'listening' or 'seeing what happens', of people 'leading their lives in our heads', while we know that this is not literally true. Are they metaphors? Are they figurative in some other way? I want to suggest that the best way to think of what we're trying to capture here is a certain image we have of the mind and its functioning, an image that involves thinking of the mind as a place or stage. Strictly speaking, that's not what the mind is. But, I suggest, we can't do better. 

As a digression, it may be relevant to flesh out is the act of creating a fictional character. What is the status and significance of these strange mental births? What it is that people have to do or believe or imagine in order to provide the characters they have created with a mental repertoire? Could such a repertoire be borrowed; for instance when writer Jane Rule admits that a subjective quirk of hers is to give each character something of her own [@rule1979aa, p. 34]?

Character building aside, if I am right, then we can see how it is understandable that patients who suffer from severe cases of mental disturbance, instability or pathology use the language they do. For it is the language we ourselves already use in describing what's on our mind.
